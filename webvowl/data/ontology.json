      "en" : "Scope note:\t\nThis class comprises complete sets of signs present in publications, reflecting publishers’ final decisions as to both content and layout of the publications.\n\nExamples:\nThe text, its layout and the textual and graphic (Saur’s logo on p. [i]) content of front and back cover, spine (spine title), and p. [i-iv] of the publication entitled ‘Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: final report’, published by K. G. Saur in 1998, identified by ISBN ‘3-598-11382-X’\n\nThe overall content of the book identified by ISBN ‘0-8014-9130-4’: the text of Stephen Crane’s complete poems as edited by Joseph Katz, the numbering system introduced by Joseph Katz in order to identify each individual poem by Stephen Crane, page numbers, the text of Joseph Katz’s dedication, preface, acknowledgements, and introduction, the table of contents, the index of first lines, the statements found on title page, back of title page (including CIP bibliographic record), cover front, back front, and spine, and the layout of the publication; for one of Stephen Crane’s longer poems, printed on p. 142-143, a statement reads at bottom of p. 142: ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’: obviously, this statement does not belong to the Self-Contained Expression intended by Stephen Crane, and presumably not to the one intended by editor Joseph Katz either, but was more probably added by the publishing team, due to characteristics of the layout of the publication: a cautious reader can easily interpret ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’ as non-belonging to the poem itself, but an OCR process would not make the distinction between the text of the poem and the statement made by the publisher; ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’ belongs to the Publication Expression, although it does not belong to the Self-Contained Expression intended by Stephen Crane and Joseph Katz\n\nThe overall content of the LP sound recording identified by label and label number ‘CBS 34-61237’: a recorded performance of Terry Riley’s musical work ‘In C’, the text of liner notes by Paul Williams translated into French by Bernard Weinberg, technical statements such as ‘Stereo,’ publisher’s logo, series logo, title and statement of responsibility on front, back, and spine of the cover and on the recording itself, duration statement, cover art by G. Joly, overall layout, etc.; a special, shunting sound was added at the end of side one and beginning of side two, as Terry Riley’s work is in the form of a continuous musical flow without any interruption and the technical possibilities of vinyl LPs did not allow the complete performance to be contained on just one side: that special, shunting sound was not intended in Riley’s score nor in the performance but was added by the publisher (with or without Riley’s consent, this detail is not documented), and as such it is part of the Publication Expression although it is not part of the composer’s and the performers’ Self-Contained Expression (this shunting sound was no longer needed in subsequent releases on CD)\n\nThe overall content of the DVD entitled ‘The Aviator (2-Disc Full Screen Edition)’, released in 2004: Martin Scorsese’s movie itself; layout of the box and the two DVDs contained in the box; pictures on the DVDs themselves; English, Spanish, and French subtitles; English and French audio tracks; and bonuses: commentaries by director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and producer Michael Mann; a deleted scene (‘Howard Tells Ava About His Car Accident’); and featurettes ‘A Life Without Limits: The Making of The Aviator’; ‘The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History’; ‘Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes, A Documentary by the History Channel’; ‘The Visual Effects of The Aviator’; ‘The Affliction of Howard Hughes: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder’; ‘The Age of Glamour: The Hair And Makeup of The Aviator’; ‘Costuming The Aviator: The Work of Sandy Powell’; ‘Constructing The Aviator: The Work of Dante Ferretti’; ‘An evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda’; ‘OCD Panel Discussion With Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, and Howard Hughes’ Widow Terry Moore’; ‘Still Gallery’; ‘Scoring The Aviator: The Work Of Howard Shore’; and ‘The Wainwright Family – Loudon, Rufus and Martha’\n\t\t"

Murders in the rue Morgue (French)’ for the French rendition of Poe’s ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’ by Baudelaire, an Agency implicitly states that the French text does not constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work, however the original English text does constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work.\n\nExamples:\nChoosing the English text entitled ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’, with that particular formulation of its title, as representative for the complex work Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’\n\t\t"

A specific case of transfer of custody is theft. The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody is in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.

A Reproduction Event results in new instances of E84 Information Carrier coming into existence. In general, the copy will have different attributes from the original and they are therefore not regarded as siblings.\n\nThis class makes it possible to account for the legal distinction between private copying for the purpose of “fair use,” and mass production for the purpose of dissemination.\n\nIt can prove difficult to determine where to draw the line between F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event in cases where multiple copies are produced. In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference. As a consequence, F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event are not declared as disjoint, which makes it possible to account for such situations that could be regarded as instances of both Production Event and Reproduction Event.\n\nExamples:\nMy photocopying now for my own private use an exemplar of the article entitled ‘Federal Court’s Ruling Against Photocopying Chain Will Not Destroy “Fair Use”’ by Kenneth D. Crews, issued in ‘Chronicle of higher education’, 17 April 1991, A48\n\nThe BnF’s producing in 1997 the microfilm identified by call number ‘Microfilm M-12169’ of the exemplar identified by shelf mark ‘Res 8 P 10’ of Amerigo Vespucci’s ‘Mundus novus’ published in Paris ca. 1503-1504\n\nThe BnF’s reproducing in 2001 the exemplar identified by call number ‘NC His Master’s Voice HC 20’ of a 78 rpm phonogram released by Gramophone in 1932, as part of the CD identified by call number ‘SDCR 2120’\n\nThe BnF’s making in 2003 a digitisation, identified by call number ‘IFN 7701015’, of the collection of drawings (held by the BnF) that were made by Étienne-Louis Boullée in 1784 for his project of a ‘Newton Cenotaph’\n\t\t"

The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\n\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- currency: £26.00\n- length: 3.9-4.1 cm\n- diameter: 26 mm\n- weight: 150 lbs\n- density: 0.85 gm/cc\n- luminescence: 56 ISO lumens\n- tin content: 0.46 %\n- taille au garot: 5 hands\n- calibrated C14 date: 2460-2720 years, etc\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE54(x) ⊃ E1(x)"

They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.\n\nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.\n\nThis definition coincides with the definition of \"fiat objects\" (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of \"bona fide objects\".\n\nExamples:\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza\n- Michael Jackson's nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE26(x) ⊃ E18(x)"

An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\n\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\n\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as \"preferred identifier assignment\", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.\n\nExamples:\n- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- Assigning the author-uniform title heading \"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as \"short cuts\" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.\n\nIn particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.\n\nExamples:\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr's silver cup in February 1997\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE13(x) ⊃ E7(x)"

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- here -> <-\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"

The substance of F2 Expression is signs.\n\nExpressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.\n\nInasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.\n\nThe genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.\n\nAn expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.\n\nIf an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to linguistic objects only).\n\nExamples:\nThe Italian text of Dante’s ‘Divina Commedia’ as found in the authoritative critical edition ‘La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi’, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4) (F22)\n\nThe Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the same edition (F22)\n\nNel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\t\nmi ritrovai per una selva oscura\t\nché la diritta via era smarrita [the Italian text of the first stanza of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ and ‘Divina Commedia’] (F23)\n\nThe signs which make up Christian Morgenstern’s ‘Fisches Nachtgesang’ [a poem consisting simply of “-” and “˘” signs, arranged in a determined combination] (F22)\n\t\t"

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. \n\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE77(x) ⊃ E1(x)"

Normally, items are considered \"new\" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \"new\" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token.

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, man-made or natural.\n\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\n\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.\n\nWe model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19)\n- the cave \"Ideon Andron\" in Crete (E26)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE18(x) ⊃ E72(x)\nE18(x) ⊃ E92(x)"

The FRBRoo 'Publication Expression' is itself an immaterial (ideal) version of a text. However it adds concreteness to the 'Expression', it has a publisher, a publishing date, page numbers, an ISBN and so on. The Publication Expression is a text on the ontological level usually cited in literary studies.\nThe INT1 Text Passage is an identifiable part (a paragraph, a couple of lines, and so forth) of the 'Publication Expression' - a 'Publication Expression Fragment', so to speak.\n\nNOTE: In order to link instances of this class to online resources, it is recommended to refer to the 'open annotation standard', to be precise: to link text passages with oa:hasselector to instances of the subclasses of oa:selector.\n\nFor Example:\n- the words 'Abandon all hope ye who enter here' from page 3 of the publication identified by the ISBN 978-0307278630."

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises the sums of concepts which appear in the course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions that are dominated by the original idea. The substance of Work is concepts. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept.\n\nA Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression, that might be taken from other work(s).\n\nA Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time. The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of “snap-shots” of a work.\n\nA Work may aggregate expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.\n\nExamples:\nAbstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 1st state’ (F14)\n\n‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin conceived between 1880 and 1917 (F15)\n\n‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare (F15)\n\t\t"

This class characterises the externalisation of an Individual Work.\n\nAlthough F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s mind. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s mind and the auditor’s mind are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging & Classification Quarterly (2005). Vol. 39, No. 3-4. P. 179-195).\n\nExamples:\nThe creation of the original manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1942 in Warsaw\n\nThe reconstruction from memory of the manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1945 after the original score was destroyed during the war\n\nThe recording of the third alternate take of ‘Blue Hawaii’ performed by Elvis Presley in Hollywood, Calif., Radio Recorders, on March 22nd, 1961 [each individual take is a distinct instance of F2 Expression]\n\t\t"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of immobile objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a section of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. [Scope Note for E53 Place in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]\n\nNote that Places may be determined by the location of historical or contemporary objects, geographic features, events or geo-political units.\n\nExamples:\nThe area referred to as ‘Lutèce’\nThe area referred to as ‘verso of the title page of the Library of Congress’s copy of the 1st edition of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’\n\t\t"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises the immaterial realisations of individual works at a particular time that are regarded as a complete whole. The quality of wholeness reflects the intention of its creator that this expression should convey the concept of the work. Such a whole can in turn be part of a larger whole.\n\nInherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. A Self-Contained Expression may contain expressions or parts of expressions from other work, such as citations or items collected in anthologies. Even though they are incorporated in the Self-Contained Expression, they are not regarded as becoming members of the expressed container work by their inclusion in the expression, but are rather regarded as foreign or referred elements.\n\nF22 Self-Contained Expression can be distinguished from F23 Expression Fragment in that an F23 Expression Fragment was not intended by its creator to make sense by itself. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard an expression as self-contained.\n\nExamples:\nThe Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the authoritative critical edition La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4)\n\nThe musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lied known as ‘Ave Maria’\n\nThe musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lieder cycle entitled ‘Seven Songs after Walter Scott’s The Lady of the Lake’, of which ‘Ave Maria’ is a distinct part\n\nThe musical notation of Franz Liszt’s piano transcription of Franz Schubert’s lied known as ‘Ave Maria’\n\t\t"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.\n\nTypically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, ‘Impressionism’ can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\n[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]\n\n[Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]\n\nExamples:\nThe battle of Trafalgar\n\nPrinting for the publisher named ‘Doubleday’ in 2003 all the copies of the first print run of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’ (F32)\n\nHaving the initial idea that eventually resulted in the existence of the opera entitled ‘Der fliegende Holländer’ (F27)\n\nCreating for Mozart’s 41st symphony the uniform title that was thereafter consistently used to refer unambiguously to that symphony everywhere in the Library of Congress’s catalogue (F40)\n\t\t"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises works that have more than one work as members.\n\nThe members of a Complex Work may constitute components of the overall concept or be alternatives to other members of the work. In practice, no clear line can be drawn between parallel and subsequent processes in the evolution of a work. One part may not be finished when another is already revised. An initially monolithic work may be taken up and evolve in pieces. The member relationship of Work is based on the conceptual relationship, and should not be confused with the internal structural parts of an individual expression. The fact that an expression may contain parts from other work(s) does not make the expressed work complex. For instance, an anthology for which only one version exists is not a complex work.\n\nThe boundaries of a Complex Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. Thus, derivations such as translations are regarded as belonging to the same Complex Work, even though in addition they constitute an Individual Work themselves. In contrast, a Work that significantly takes up and merges concepts of other works so that it is no longer dominated by the initial concept is regarded as a new work. In cataloguing practice, detailed rules are established prescribing which kinds of derivation should be regarded as crossing the boundaries of a complex work. Adaptation and derivation graphs allow the recognition of distinct sub-units, i.e. a complex work contained in a larger complex work.\n\nAs a Complex Work can be taken up by any creator who acquires the spirit of its concept, it is never finished in an absolute sense.\nExamples:\nWork entitled ‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin\n\nWork entitled ‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare\n\nWork entitled ‘Der Ring der Nibelungen’ by Richard Wagner\n\nWork entitled ‘Carceri d’invenzione’ by Giovanni Battista Piranesi\n\nWork entitled ‘Mass in B minor BWV 232’ by Johann Sebastian Bach\n\t\t"

The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. \"construction\", \"decoration\" etc.\nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.\n\nExamples:\n- coffee mug - OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note \"chipped at edge of handle\" (E62) has type\nCondition (E55)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP3(x,y) ⊃ E1(x)\nP3(x,y) ⊃ E62(y)\nP3(x,y,z) ⊃ [P3(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n\nProperties: P3.1 has type: E55 Type"

      "en" : "Scope note:\nThis property associates a publication, i.e. an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type, with an instance of E60 Number, which denotes the number of physical units all exemplars of that publication should consist of, as long as they are recognised as complete exemplars of that publication. Typically, this property is observed on one exemplar of a publication, and extrapolated to all other exemplars of the same publication. This logical inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation Product Type R7B has example F5 Item P57has number of parts E60 Number.\n\nIt can happen that a given exemplar, or subset of exemplars, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with that characteristic, accidentally lacks it. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation Product Type.\n\nExamples:\nThe jigsaw puzzle entitled ‘Map of the New York city subway system’, designed by Stephen J. Voorhies and released around 1954 by the Union Dimes Savings Bank (F3) CLP57 should have number of parts 76 (E60) [Number of physical units of the exemplar held by the Library of Congress, as observed by a cataloguer from the Library of Congress when he/she catalogued that particular exemplar and recorded the statement: ‘1 jigsaw puzzle (ca. 76 pieces)’]\n\nThe publication entitled ‘History of costume: in slides, notes, and commentaries’ by Jeanne Button, Patricia Quinn Stuart, and Stephen Sbarge, released by Slide Presentations (New York) ca. 1975 (F3) CLP57 should have number of parts 1,491 (E60) [Number of physical units of the exemplar held by the Gelman Library of the George Washington University, as observed by a cataloguer from the Gelman Library of the George Washington University when he/she catalogued that particular exemplar and recorded the statement: ‘1,491 slides in 14 slide trays + 6 ring binders in cases (30 x 29 cm.)’]\n\t\t"

It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc. In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of the manuscript page\nIt is an implicit transitive property.\n\nExamples:\t\n\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) P165 incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E38) P165 incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E38) P165 incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E73(x)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E90(y)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ P106(x,y)"

This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.\n\nFor instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.\n\nThis property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully\ndeveloped path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.\n\nIn contrast to P156 occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span. Further it does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP156 (x,y) = [E18(x) ∧ E53(y) ∧ P161(x,y) ∧ P157(y,x)]"
